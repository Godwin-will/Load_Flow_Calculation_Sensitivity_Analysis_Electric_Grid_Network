The network used for this PyPowerSysBL tutorial consists of 6 voltage levels, all of which are connected by 
parallel lines with the same electrotechnical characteristics (same resistance and reactance) as well as two HVDC lines and a phase-shifting transformer. It has 4 generating units and 3 loads.
